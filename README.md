**Purpose**
- The goal of this project is to gain hands-on experience with **Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS)** by building a domain environment in a virtual lab. I set up a **Windows Server Domain Controller** to manage users, groups, and policies, and connected Windows client machines to the domain. This project gave me practical experience with authentication, DNS/DHCP configuration, and group policy management in a simulated enterprise network.

**Tools Used** 
- VirtualBox
- Windows Server (Domain Controller_
- Windows 10 (Client VM)
- Kali Linux (attacker)
- Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS)
- DNS & DHCP roles

**Overview of Steps**
-  Installed and configured Windows Server as a Domain Controller.
-  Set up Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS) and created a domain.
-  Configured DNS and DHCP roles to handle name resolution and IP assignments.
-  Created and managed users, groups, and organizational units (OUs).
-  Applied Group Policy Objects (GPOs) to enforce security policies.
-  Joined a Windows 10 client machine to the domain and verified domain login.
